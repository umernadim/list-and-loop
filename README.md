# üìò C# List and Loop Practice

This project contains various **C# List and Loop exercises** designed to help practice working with collections, iteration, and conditions.
The goal of these tasks is to understand how lists work in C#, how to manipulate data inside them, and how to combine loops and conditional statements for logical operations.

## üß† Topics Covered

* **List Initialization and Iteration**
* **Adding, Inserting, and Removing Items**
* **Conditional Checks (Contains, Filtering, etc.)**
* **Sorting and Reversing Lists**
* **Combining Loops and Conditions**

## üßæ Summary

| Concept            | Description                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **List**           | A dynamic collection of items that can grow or shrink. |
| **foreach Loop**   | Iterates through each element in the collection.       |
| **Add / Remove**   | Manage elements dynamically.                           |
| **Conditionals**   | Combine logic for decision-making in loops.            |
| **Sort / Reverse** | Control and organize list data.                        |

## üèÅ Conclusion

By completing these exercises, I‚Äôve learned:

* How to create and manipulate lists.
* How to use loops and conditions together.
* How to perform practical list operations like sorting, filtering, and searching.
